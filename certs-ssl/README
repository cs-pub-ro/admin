check-cert is a Bash script for checking certificate expiry on remote hosts.
Hostnames are provided to standard input. Sample runs:

    $ cat hosts-to-check | ./check-cert
    W: acse.pub.ro
    X: aimas.cs.pub.ro
    E: anaconda.cs.pub.ro
    [...]

    $ echo vmchecker.cs.pub.ro | ./check-cert
    O: vmchecker.cs.pub.ro

    $ echo planet.cs.pub.ro | ./check-cert
    O: planet.cs.pub.ro


W means warning (soon to expire)
E means expired (needs to be replaced)
O means OK
