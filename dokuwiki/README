			  and HTTPS support)
dokuwiki-ldap-auth*	- LDAP snippet configuration (part of
			  $DW_ROOT/conf/local.php


= Installing DokuWiki =


As a prerequisite, the script assumes the folder where DokuWiki is to be
installed uses group www-data and the setgid bit is enabled. This is
required in order to provide write access to the web server user to
data/ and conf/ subfolders.

In case you are unable or unwilling to provide that configuration, you
would have to update two lines in the `dw-install' script. Instead of:
    ---
    # Adding write permissions to conf/ and data/ folders.
    chmod -R g+w conf/
    chmod -R g+w data/
    ---
you would have to use:
    ---
    # Adding write permissions to conf/ and data/ folders.
    chmod -R a+w conf/
    chmod -R a+w data/
    ---
This way you will grant write access to all users, thus including
www-data. Be careful, though, as this is a security issue.

Three arguments are passed to the install script:
* the DokuWiki install directory
* the URL of the DokuWiki archive
* the accessible URL for the future DokuWiki installation

The DokuWiki install directory will be created in case it doesn't exist.
Remember the use of the setgid bit. In case the install directory is not
empty, the installation process aborts.

DokuWiki archives are typically found here[1]. Pass the URL to the
archive to the install script. I usually choose the current "stable"
version as pointed out in the site.

Running the `dw-install' script with no arguments presents a usage
message and a sample run, such as the one below:
---
./dw-install ~/public_html/dw-test/ http://www.splitbrain.org/_media/projects/dokuwiki/dokuwiki-2011-05-25a.tgz http://swarm.cs.pub.ro/~razvan/dw-test
---

While the script is running, it's also showing a log of activities, such
as installing DokuWiki or various plugins.

When the script ends, the user is presented with a set of steps to
follow:
---
1. Open in web browser: http://localhost/gogu/install.php
2. Fill required information to complete the basic installation.
3. Remove lala/install.php.bak file.
4. Run:
   ./dw-post-install /home/razvan/public_html/dw-test/ /~razvan/dw-test/
---

Accessing the browser is required for basic configuration of DokuWiki.
We are currently looking for ways to automate this. The complete
configuration (deploying pretty URLs and HTTPS support) is created
through the use of the `dw-post-install' script.

You should run the `dw-post-install' script with the arguments presented
at the end of the `dw-install' script.

The `dw-post-install' script is actually responsible for two things:
i)  Updating the $DW_ROOT/conf/local.php file. That means wiki and plugin
    configuration. The configuration is what we commonly use. Go through
    file and update it according to your needs/preferences.
ii) Creating the $DW_ROOT/.htaccess file. This file is responsible with
    the configuration of pretty (hierarchical) URLs and HTTPS support.

= Upgrading DokuWiki =


About every 6 months a new "stable" version of DokuWiki appears. This is
signaled for an administrative logged in account through a notification
in the wiki header.

Upgrading DokuWiki is usually accomplished by copying the new DokuWiki
files and the new plugins versions.

The are two scripts you may use. One is to be run by root (the
`dw-upgrade' script), while the other (the `dw-upgrade-no-root` script)
may be run by a non-priviliged user. Each script creates a backup copy
of the current wiki installation before upgrading.

The `dw-upgrade' script (run by root) is to be used when your backup
needs to be web accessible. The backup uses the precises ownership
information and access rights (may be owned by `www-data') such that it
would be an exact copy of the original DokuWiki installation. In order
for the backup copy to be completely accesible, its `.htaccess' file
should probably be updated.

The backup directory passed to the scripts should exist. This is where
the actual backup is created using a name starting with `dokuwiki-bak'.

Sample run scripts:
    ./dw-upgrade ~razvan/public_html/dw-test/ http://www.splitbrain.org/_media/projects/dokuwiki/dokuwiki-2011-05-25a.tgz ~razvan/public_html/backup/
    ./dw-upgrade-no-root ~razvan/public_html/dw-test/ http://www.splitbrain.org/_media/projects/dokuwiki/dokuwiki-2011-05-25a.tgz ~razvan/public_html/backup/
